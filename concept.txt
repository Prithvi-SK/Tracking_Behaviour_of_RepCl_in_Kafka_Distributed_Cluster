⟨mx.j, bitmap.j[], offset.j[], counter.j[]⟩

mx.j: Max epoch that process j is aware of.

bitmap.j[]: Indicates for which processes the offset is explicitly maintained.

offset.j[]: Stores the offset (i.e., mx.j - mx.k) for process k.

counter.j[]: Distinguishes multiple events in the same epoch.



Shift: Changes mx and adjusts all offsets accordingly. Ensures offset ≤ ε.

MergeSameEpoch: Combines two timestamps by taking the min of offsets for each process.

EqualOffset: Compares two timestamps for equal offsets and mx values.
